# Stress Tracker

A real-time web application that allows users to track and share their stress levels. The application enables users to record their stress levels on a scale of 0-200, view historical data, and receive live updates when other users update their stress levels.

## Features

- **Simple Authentication**: Username-only login system with one active session per IP
- **Stress Recording**: Track stress levels (0-200) with a 5-minute cooldown between updates
- **Superstress Button**: Record maximum stress level (200) once per day
- **Historical Data**: View your stress levels over time as a line graph
- **Real-time Updates**: See live updates when any user records their stress level
- **Public Summary**: View all users' latest stress levels and overall average stress

| **Real-time** | WebSocket (via `@fastify/websocket`) | Provides live updates of stress levels              |
| **Container** | Docker (multi-stage build)           | Single container serving both API & static frontend |

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Node.js 18+ (for development)

### Running with Docker

1. Clone this repository
2. Set up the environment file:

```bash
cp .env.template .env
```

3. Edit the `.env` file to update environment variables, especially:

   - `SESSION_SECRET`: Change to a secure random string
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Add your OpenAI API key
   - `FRONTEND_URL`: Update if needed
   - `VITE_API_URL`: Set to match your host/domain

4. Build and start the application:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

If you encounter architecture-related errors (especially on ARM-based Macs like M1/M2/M3):

```bash
# For Docker Compose V2
DOCKER_DEFAULT_PLATFORM=linux/amd64 docker compose up --build

# For Docker Compose V1
DOCKER_DEFAULT_PLATFORM=linux/amd64 docker-compose up --build
```

5. Access the application at http://localhost:8000

### Development Setup

#### Backend

1. Navigate to the backend directory:

```bash
cd backend
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The backend will be available at http://localhost:3000

#### Frontend

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:

```bash
cd frontend
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Access the frontend at http://localhost:5173

## API Endpoints

### Authentication

- `POST /login` - User login
- `GET /me` - Get current user info
- `POST /logout` - User logout

### Stress Management

- `POST /stress` - Record stress level (with 5-minute rate limiting)
- `POST /stress/superstress` - Record superstress (with daily limit)
- `GET /stress/history` - Get stress history data
- `GET /stress/average` - Get average stress level
- `GET /summary` - Public endpoint showing all users' latest stress levels and average

### WebSockets

- `/ws` - Authenticated WebSocket endpoint for real-time updates
- `/ws/summary` - Public WebSocket endpoint for summary updates

## Testing

Various test scripts are available in the backend directory:

- `test-auth.js` - Test authentication functionality
- `test-cooldown.js` - Test rate limiting cooldown
- `test-ip-username.js` - Test IP-username associations
- `test-websocket.js` - Test WebSocket functionality

## Deployment

The application is containerized using Docker and can be deployed to any environment that supports Docker containers. The Docker setup includes:

- Multi-stage build for optimized image size
- Volume for SQLite database persistence
- Health check for container monitoring
